# contagion window models

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## abstract

Contagion window models are designed to forecast large-scale infections with time-sensitive transmission probabilities. Infected nodes are grouped by the day on which their infections began, and the infectiousness of each group depends on how long it has been infected.

A daily contagion [window] is a vector $\mathbf{w}$ whose components $w_i$ are estimated mean transmission counts for a node $i$ days after it is infected. Like $\beta$ in a [SIR model], window counts can be influenced by the collective behaviors of individual nodes. Unlike SIR models, discrete window models obey a difference equation.

## definitions

## evolution

Time evolution of $x_t$ is governed by a [master equation]:
$$
x_{t+1} = \frac{S_t}{N}(\mathbf{w} * \mathbf{x})_t
$$
where <dfn>susceptiblility</dfn> term is the fraction of nodes which are neither vaccinated nor exposed:
$$
\frac{S_t}{N}
= \frac{N(1-v) - X_t}{N}
= 1 - v - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} x_i
$$
and the <dfn>contagion</dfn> term is the sum of recent daily infections weighted by window counts:
$$
(\mathbf{w} * \mathbf{x})_t
= \sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} w_i x_{t-i}
= w_0 x_t + w_1 x_{t-1} + \cdots + w_{\tau-1}x_{t-(\tau-1)}
= \sum_{i=0}^{\tau-1} w_i x_{t-i}
$$

## scenarios

### count the days

{natural window with citations}

### flatten the curve

{reduce $|\mathbf{w}|$ by decreasing contact frequency}

### close the window

In this scenario, infectious nodes quarantine themselves when symptoms present. This strategy is effective if and only if nodes become infectious *after* symptoms become obvious.

<blockquote>
Many (especially young people) might not notice any symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. Then they donâ€™t know they have the virus and can pass it on to people in risk groups.

### slam the brakes

If nodes become infections *before* symptoms become obvious, then "closing the window" may be insufficient to halt an epidemic.

### kill the virus

{no eradication without vaccination}

### don't wait and see

### don't jump the gun
